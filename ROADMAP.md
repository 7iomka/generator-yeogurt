# Yeogurt Roadmap

## v0.10.1
* Update prompts, tests, and generator to make React JSX syntax optional
* Update prompts, tests, and generator to enable Flux architecure for React projects
* Fix Backbone routes so they don't use the `default:` property. It breaks IE8 compatibility.
* Fix issue where `test` folder is created for React projects when unit testing is disabled
